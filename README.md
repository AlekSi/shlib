portable functions for posix shell environments

I've sadly written a lot of shell scripts.   Mostly for installers on
completely alien environments.

Really shell or bash should only be used for boot-strapping to something
sane.  Until then you might need some truly portable functions.

I hope you never need to use them, but if you do they are [public domain](http://unlicense.org).  Do whatever you'd like with them.

However acknowledgement (and pull requests) are appreciated.  You can optionally include [license.sh](license.sh) so the next person knows where to find them.
