portable functions for posix shell environments

I've sadly written a lot of shell scripts.   Mostly for installers on
completely alien environments.

Really shell or bash should only be used for boot-strapping to something
sane.  Until then you might need some truly portable functions.

I present these in hope you never need to use them.
